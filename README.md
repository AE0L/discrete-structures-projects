## Discrete Structures Projects
A collection of the machine problems we were tasked to complete as a requirement in my Discrete Structures class here in Polytechnic University of the Philippine (PUP). There are also some personal projects included in this repo and not all of them are complete and fully functional (free of bugs and errors).

## Projects List
